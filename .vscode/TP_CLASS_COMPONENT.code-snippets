	// Place your games_plat workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"TP_CLASS_COMPONENT": {
		"scope": "typescriptreact",
		"prefix": "TP_CLASS_COMPONENT",
		"body": [
			"import React, { useState, useEffect, Component } from 'react';",
			"interface iPorps {",
  		"	$1",
			"}",
			"interface iState { ",
			"	$2",
			"}",
			"export class $0 extends Component<iPorps, iState> {",
  		"	constructor(props: iPorps) { ",
			"		super(props); ",
			" 	this.state = {",
